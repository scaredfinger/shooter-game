# AI Analysis - Shooter Game Project

## Developer Profile
- **Experience**: 25+ years of dedicated software development experience
- **Approach**: Methodical, prefers small testable increments
- **Repository**: `scaredfinger/shooter-game`

## Project Vision
Browser-based top-down shooter game with infinite ammo primary weapons, limited secondary weapons, and extensive configurability for maps and character customization.

## Core Gameplay Requirements

### 1. Perspective & Mechanics
- **View**: Top-down with perspective, but flat (no depth/distance calculations needed)
- **Primary Weapons**: Infinite ammo with upgrade/power-up levels
- **Secondary Weapons**: Limited ammo/usage (grenades, rockets, special abilities)
- **Player Mode**: Single-player focused, but architecture should not prevent multiplayer addition

### 2. Enemy Types & Behavior
- **Human Enemies**: Various AI patterns (chase, patrol, etc.)
- **Mechanical Enemies**: Armored vehicles, planes, tanks
- **Spawn System**: Configurable (waves, continuous, map-based placement)
- **AI Behavior**: Different patterns per enemy type, configurable

### 3. Configurability Requirements
- **Maps**: Easily configurable level layouts
- **Character Skins**: Swappable player and enemy appearances
- **Weapons**: Configurable upgrade paths and secondary weapon types
- **Enemy Spawning**: Flexible spawn configuration system

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Rendering
- **Primary Choice**: Canvas 2D (easier initial development)
- **Future Option**: WebGL migration possible for performance
- **Rationale**: Canvas 2D perfect for top-down perspective, faster prototyping

### Configuration System
- **Format**: JSON-based configuration files
- **Maps**: Tile-based or object placement definitions
- **Assets**: Local file storage with JSON manifests
- **Skins**: JSON-defined sprite mappings and properties

### Project Structure
```
/src
  /core       - Game engine (loop, input, collision detection)
  /entities   - Player, enemies, projectiles classes
  /graphics   - Sprite management, rendering systems
  /config     - JSON schemas and configuration loaders
  /maps       - Level definitions and map data
  /assets     - Images, sounds, and other media
```

### Development Environment
- **Container**: VS Code devcontainer support required
- **Runtime**: Browser-based, no server-side requirements
- **Testing**: Should be runnable in minutes after changes

## Development Methodology

### Workflow Requirements
1. **Branching**: Create feature branches, merge to main
2. **Commits**: Standard format (feat/, chore/, doc/)
3. **Incremental**: Small, testable changes only
4. **Verification**: Always verify file paths exist before modifications
5. **Minimal Changes**: Avoid non-required modifications

### Development Priority Order
1. **Foundation**: Basic game loop + canvas setup
2. **Player System**: Entity with movement and basic sprite rendering
3. **Combat Basic**: Simple shooting mechanics (primary weapon)
4. **Enemy System**: Basic enemy spawning and movement
5. **Collision**: Detection and response system
6. **Configuration**: Map loading and configuration system
7. **Progression**: Weapon upgrades and secondary weapons
8. **Polish**: Enhanced graphics, sound, effects

## Technical Constraints & Considerations

### Performance
- Canvas 2D should handle typical gameplay loads
- Sprite-based rendering for all entities
- Efficient collision detection for multiple entities
- Frame rate targeting 60fps

### Extensibility
- Modular enemy AI system
- Plugin-style weapon system
- JSON-driven content loading
- Clean separation of game logic and rendering

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browser support (ES6+)
- Canvas 2D API reliance
- No external dependencies initially
- Local storage for game state/settings

## Key Design Patterns

### Entity System
- Base Entity class with common properties (position, sprite, health)
- Specialized classes for Player, Enemy, Projectile
- Component-based behavior system for flexibility

### Configuration Loading
- Asynchronous JSON loading system
- Validation and error handling for malformed configs
- Hot-reloading support for development

### Input Management
- Keyboard input handling (WASD movement, mouse aiming/shooting)
- Event-driven input system
- Configurable key bindings support

## Success Criteria
- Game runs smoothly in VS Code devcontainer
- Player can move, shoot, and engage enemies
- Maps and skins can be swapped via JSON configuration
- Code is maintainable and extensible
- Each increment produces a testable game state

## Future Considerations
- WebGL migration path for advanced effects
- Multiplayer architecture compatibility
- User-generated content support
- Mobile browser optimization
- Audio system integration
